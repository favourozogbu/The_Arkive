# The Arkive

A play on words combining Augmented Reality (AR) and Archive. The Arkive is a social media based augmented reality scrapbooking platform, developed from scratch as a safe alternative to metaverses for people to document, organise, annotate, and share memories with others through the integration and/or overlaying of real-world content.
